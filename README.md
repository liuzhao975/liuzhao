## üìÅ Code Structure Overview

### ‚Ö†. Inflow Forecast Module

#### 1. API-based Forecast

**Input:**
- `'Parameters'` sheet  
  - **Baseflow**: Runoff data of nine reservoirs (previous and current year).  
  - **Rainfall Database**: Rainfall data of nine reservoirs (at least the past 20 days + next 3 days forecast).

**Output:**
- `'Inflow'` sheet ‚Üí `'Qin'`: Predicted inflow for the next **3 days**.

#### 2. LSTM-based Forecast

**Input:**
- `'Parameters'` sheet ‚Üí `'Sheet1'`: Runoff data of nine reservoirs (longer series yields better accuracy).

**Output:**
- `'Inflow'` sheet ‚Üí `'Qin'`: Predicted inflow for the next **3 days**.

### ‚Ö°. Main Program ‚Äî Optimization Scheduling

**Input:**
1. `'Inflow'` sheet: 3-day forecast data (real-time data for the current day must be manually added).  
2. `'data'` sheet ‚Üí `'crtcndtn'`: Real-time water levels and outflows of nine reservoirs  
   - Odd columns: water levels  
   - Even columns: outflows  

**Output (Saved in `'NBresult(1)'` workbook):**
